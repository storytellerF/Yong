If the `Lifecycle` is destroyed within the block of                    
`Lifecycle.whenStarted` or any similar `Lifecycle.when` method is
suspended,                     the block will be cancelled, which will
also cancel any child coroutine                     launched inside the
block. As as a result, If you have a try finally block                  
  in your code, the finally might run after the Lifecycle moves outside 
                   the desired state. It is recommended to check the
`Lifecycle.isAtLeast`                     before accessing UI in finally
block. Similarly,                     if you have a catch statement that
might catch `CancellationException`,                     you should
check the `Lifecycle.isAtLeast` before accessing the UI. See            
        documentation of `Lifecycle.whenStateAtLeast` for more details.

(##) Including

!!!
   This is not a built-in check. To include it, add the below dependency
   to your project.

```
// build.gradle.kts
implementation("androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-ktx:2.6.1")

// build.gradle
implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-ktx:2.6.1'

// build.gradle.kts with version catalogs:
implementation(libs.lifecycle-runtime-ktx)

# libs.versions.toml
[versions]
lifecycle-runtime-ktx = "2.6.1"
[libraries]
lifecycle-runtime-ktx = {
    module = "androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-ktx",
    version.ref = "lifecycle-runtime-ktx"
}
```

2.6.1 is the version this documentation was generated from;
there may be newer versions available.

(##) Suppressing

You can suppress false positives using one of the following mechanisms:

* Using a suppression annotation like this on the enclosing
  element:

  ```kt
  // Kotlin
  @Suppress("UnsafeLifecycleWhenUsage")
  fun method() {
     whenCreated(...)
  }
  ```

  or

  ```java
  // Java
  @SuppressWarnings("UnsafeLifecycleWhenUsage")
  void method() {
     whenCreated(...);
  }
  ```

* Using a suppression comment like this on the line above:

  ```kt
  //noinspection UnsafeLifecycleWhenUsage
  problematicStatement()
  ```

* Using a special `lint.xml` file in the source tree which turns off
  the check in that folder and any sub folder. A simple file might look
  like this:
  ```xml
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
  &lt;lint&gt;
      &lt;issue id="UnsafeLifecycleWhenUsage" severity="ignore" /&gt;
  &lt;/lint&gt;
  ```
  Instead of `ignore` you can also change the severity here, for
  example from `error` to `warning`. You can find additional
  documentation on how to filter issues by path, regular expression and
  so on
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/lintxml.md.html).

* In Gradle projects, using the DSL syntax to configure lint. For
  example, you can use something like
  ```gradle
  lintOptions {
      disable 'UnsafeLifecycleWhenUsage'
  }
  ```
  In Android projects this should be nested inside an `android { }`
  block.

* For manual invocations of `lint`, using the `--ignore` flag:
  ```
  $ lint --ignore UnsafeLifecycleWhenUsage ...`
  ```

* Last, but not least, using baselines, as discussed
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/baselines.md.html).
